The admins enter their phone number and password into the login form.
The server validates the phone number and password.
If the login is successful, the server generates an access token and a refresh token.
The access token is sent in the response to the user.
The refresh token is set in the browser cookie.
The admin's _id and role are included in both the access token and the refresh token.
The access token is used to authenticate the user for subsequent requests.
The refresh token can be used to generate a new access token if the old one expires.
The _id and role are used to identify the admin and their permissions.
